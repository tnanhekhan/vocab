<summary>Dialogflow intents</summary>
The logic for the catching the spoken words of the user when using the app and doing something with it, is in the functions/dialogFlowApp folder. This file contains the intents(chunks of code that correspond to certain things a user says) and the responses that the user hears. This file is a mess, I want to keep the responses that the user hears and the logic for doing certain checks seperate. This will improve the readability.
